Explanation of the code and expected results:

1. The code focuses on Nairobi, Kenya, using the coordinates [36.8219, -1.2921].

2. It uses the Google Research Open Buildings Temporal dataset, which provides information about building presence and height over time.

3. The `addLayers` function creates two layers for each timestamp:
   - A building presence layer, visible by default, using a black-yellow-red color scheme.
   - A building height layer, hidden by default, using a blue-green-yellow-orange-red color scheme.

4. The script retrieves data for the two most recent years available in the dataset for Nairobi.

5. It then adds these layers to the map, one set for each year.

6. Finally, it centers the map on Nairobi with a zoom level of 14.

Notes after simulation:

1. Visualization: The map should show two building presence layers, one for each of the two most recent years. The color scheme (black-yellow-red) suggests that areas with higher building presence will appear more red, while areas with lower presence will be yellow to black.

2. Temporal analysis: By having layers for two different years, users can compare building presence and potentially identify areas of new development or urban growth.

3. Building height information: Although hidden by default, the building height layers provide additional information. When activated, they use a color scheme from blue (lower heights) to red (taller buildings), allowing for analysis of the city's vertical development.

4. Data availability: The actual years displayed will depend on the most recent data available in the dataset for Nairobi. The console output would show these specific years.

5. Performance: Depending on the area covered and the amount of building data, the script may take some time to load and render the layers, especially if there's significant urban development in Nairobi.

6. Limitations: The resolution and accuracy of the building detection and height estimation will depend on the underlying data in the Google Research Open Buildings Temporal dataset.

7. Potential use cases: This visualization could be useful for urban planners, researchers studying urban development, or anyone interested in analyzing the growth and changes in Nairobi's built environment over recent years.

8. Further analysis: While this script provides a visual representation, additional computational analysis could be added to quantify changes, such as calculating the total area of new development or average building height changes between the two years.

This script provides a solid foundation for visualizing and analyzing urban development in Nairobi, with the potential for further refinement and analysis based on specific research or planning needs.
